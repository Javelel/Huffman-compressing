# Huffman-compressing
Implementation of Huffman coding algorithm in Java

Method "huffman()" takes path-to-the-directory and a boolean (true if compression or false if decompression).
- The method works with file named "in.txt"
- The result of decompression is written to the file "decompressed"
- The result of compression is written to the file "out"
- The Huffman tree is saved in the file named "tree"
- The method returns the number of chars in decompressed file or the number of bits in compressed file
